<p><i><b>A world that loves to participate in real-time activities would certainly appreciate the idea of an online
auction system that opens 24/7. Unlike the traditional auctioning method, this modern system brings
together buyers and sellers from across to a single location virtually. This discards the need for the
bidder to actually travel to the site of Auction. Since the items are listed for a few days, bidders can
think and study the deal before bidding. Since, there aren't any geographical or time restrictions, the
number of bids received will be more. The cost for conducting an auction online is less when
compared to physical auction sales and the price of the items are also low. This way both parties the
buyer and the seller are benefited. Retailers, distributors and liquidators can test new products,
quickly sell off excess inventory and get new customers. Auctions taking place between customers,
companies and businesses have gained popularity.</b></i></p>
